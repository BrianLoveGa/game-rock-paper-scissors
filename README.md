**Welcome to this little game I made with some help from Gen Assemb.ly**

It is my take on the classic rock - paper - scissors with the added fun of lizard and spock options.

Simply click the big green button to play.

The prompt will ask you for your move.

Spelling counts when entering your move...

__The prompt will then alert you the computers random move from a random number generator (1-5).__

__You will then be alerted if you won or lost.__

You can also open the console log and make the computer play against itself if that tickles your fancy.

Coming soon

The ability to play repeat rounds without just refreshing the page.

A scoreboard once the above is achieved.

Moving away from the prompts and having buttons to click instead of words to type so the error of mispelling would be avoidable.
