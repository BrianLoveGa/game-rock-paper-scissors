******
It is my take on the classic rock - paper - scissors with the added fun of lizard and spock options.


To play just click the word / picture to select your move.
Then click the 3...2....1... shoot button for the computer to go once your move is picked.
Score board at botom will update after each round with Win , Loss, or Tie.


If you prefer the old way.

Simply click the big green button to play the original prompts version I had.

The prompt will ask you for your move.

Spelling counts when entering your move...

__The prompt will then alert you the computers random move from a random number generator (1-5).__

__You will then be alerted if you won or lost.__
This version does not have any effect on the scoreboard.

You can also open the console log and make the computer play against itself if that tickles your fancy.

A scoreboard once the above is achieved. ✓

Moving away from the prompts and having buttons to click instead of words to type so the error of mispelling would be avoidable. ✓
