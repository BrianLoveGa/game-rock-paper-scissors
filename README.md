__Welcome to this little game I made with some help from Gen Assemb.ly__

It is my take on the classic rock - paper - scissors with the added fun of lizard and spock options.

The prompt will ask you you move.

The prompt will then alert you the computers random move from a random number generator (1-5).

You will then be alerted if you won or lost.


Currently you must refresh to play again.

You can also open the console log and make the computer play against itself if that tickles your fancy.

Coming soon 

The ability to play repeat rounds without just refreshing the page.

A scoreboard once the above is achieved.

Moving away from the prompts and having buttons to click instead of words to type so the error of mispelling or all caps would be avoidable.
